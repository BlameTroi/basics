Just a light project for fun. I don't know if I'll extend or enhance
this at all.

As written, Moore uses cross procedure GOTO statements. My compiler (FPC)
does not support this unless using the macpas or iso language modes.
run in ISO mode unless I feel up to the restructing that would be
needed to remove the goto statements.
